# Key-value Storage with Cryptographic Client-separation

A key-value storage is presented, which in contrast to traditional access mechanism uses cryptographic methods in order to separate client data. The presented key-value storage protects the confidentiality and integrity of users against malicous service operators as well as implementation errors in the server software.

For a demo application see [Todo-iOS](https://github.com/AppPETs/Todo-iOS).

For the service, see [PrivacyService](https://github.com/AppPETs/PrivacyService).

For the key-value storage implementation, see [`SecureKeyValueStorage` documentation](https://apppets.github.io/PrivacyKit/macos/public/Classes/SecureKeyValueStorage.html)
